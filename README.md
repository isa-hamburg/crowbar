# crowbar
A small tool to reduce code-size to fit into AWS Lambda/Bref.sh limits. Reduces size by up to 60-70% depedending on included dependencies! STILL BETA VERSION! I didnt pay to much attention to code-quality as it is a little tool.


## usage
Download the crowbar.phar and execute:    
**php crowbar.phar crowbar:minify ./folder-to-minify-inplace**
